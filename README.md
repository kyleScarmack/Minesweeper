Other notes: Project name is Minesweeper. Timer starts immediately after game window is opened. Mines are generated after first click to prevent immediate game loss. I created my reading/writing logic around the original leaderboard.txt file, which has the format of min:sec, name instead of min:sec,name with no space between the comma and the name. It should work for either way, though.
